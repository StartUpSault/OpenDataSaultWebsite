    <p>Open Data is defined as structured data that is machine-readable, freely shared, used and built on without restrictions. More great resources and information is available at the <a href="http://open.canada.ca/en/open-data" target="_blank">Canada Open Data website</a></p>
    <br />
    <p>The Open Definition provides a more detailed definition of Open Data. To summarize the most important points:</p>
    <br /><br />
    <p><b>Availability and Access:</b> the data must be available as a whole and at no more than a reasonable reproduction cost, preferably by downloading over the internet. The data must also be available in a convenient and modifiable form.</p>
    <p><b>Re-use and Redistribution:</b> the data must be provided under terms that permit re-use and redistribution including the intermixing with other datasets.</p>
    <p><b>Universal Participation:</b> everyone must be able to use, re-use and redistribute. There should be no discrimination against fields of endeavour or against persons or groups. For example, 'non-commercial' restrictions that would prevent 'commercial' use, or restrictions of use for certain purposes (e.g. only in education), are not allowed.<p>
